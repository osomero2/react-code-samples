# react-code-samples
This repository is to show different kinds of ways that i use React daily.

In samples folder you can see how i have handled different kind of situations when i have done front-end development.
Mostly just different methods with arrays and some ui-stuff.

These are not the only ways to handle different situations nor the best ways but they have been proven to work.

Have a nice day!
